### 👋 Hi, I'm Carl Shipley

I'm a Principal Technical Program Manager driving Azure Fundamentals across a portfolio of cloud services. While my day job centers on strategy and program delivery, I work hands-on with:

- **Kusto queries** for surfacing insights and improving operational health
- **Dashboards & reporting** that reduce ambiguity and accelerate decision-making
- **AI-assisted workflows** (GitHub Copilot, automation scripts) to improve service health and resilience

My GitHub activity is mostly private due to the nature of my work, but I use this space to:
- Experiment with AI and Copilot in VS Code
- Build learning projects that strengthen my query and automation skills
- Explore ways to combine data, visualization, and automation for business impact
